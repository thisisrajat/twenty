#Twenty

Take a 20 second break to look at an item 20 feets from you after working 20 minutes on your computer. This web app alerts you when your 20 minutes are over. Maybe stroll around too. Don't just sit there all day, but I am not the one to talk. Working example here(http://twenty.rajatja.in).

###Todo

1.) Improve the logic of the code, definitely refactor it.
1.) Shift the page by some % height to hide the top bar when timer is on. 
1.) When the timer hits 1200, improve this logic more
1.) You got to make it pretty. Maybe more options to fine tune the app according to own needs.
